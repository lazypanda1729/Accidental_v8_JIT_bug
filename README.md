# Accidental_v8_JIT_bug

This is my exploit for an accidental bug in v8 turbofan described in the following article:
https://zon8.re/posts/exploiting-an-accidentally-discovered-v8-rce/

The exploit is a bit different then the one in the article, mostly regarding the use of fake object.
This is mostly for self reference and educational purposes. 

And above all because it's fun :)
